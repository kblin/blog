The talk I proposed for [LinuxConf.EU](http://www.linuxconf.eu/2007/)
was accepted, so I'm going to Cambridge early September. Unfortunately
this means that I actually have to write the talk I proposed to give.
Also, as I need to hand in my talk by 30th of July, I'll probably need
to write it while I'm at Campus Party in Valencia.
Oh well. I'm looking forward to another nice conference.
