The WOMBAT team is happy to announce the release of WOMBAT 0.3.0

New features for this version include:

-   Completely redesigned data backend based on SQLAlchemy
-   Support for scanning and updating the repository without running an
    extra script to generate the metadata
-   Preliminary support for Assets and Collections, the WebUI still
    needs some work.

As always, the [WOMBAT demo site](http://wombat.worldforge.org/) runs
the latest version for you to test.
