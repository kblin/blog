So far, plunger has existed in the WorldForge cvs tree out of
convenience. However, as there are quite some people interested in
plunger from outside the WorldForge project, I've decided to provide
more infrastructure than what WorldForge has right now. This includes an
issue tracker to allow people to more easily create bug reports and give
feedback.

After spending some hours to move the code from cvs to google's svn,
plunger now lives at [http://code.google.com/p/plunger/
](http://code.google.com/p/plunger/)

Expect some changes while I sort out the infrastructure I want to have
set up at the new site.
