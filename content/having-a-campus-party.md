¡Buenas tardes, compañeros!

Spending all of this week in Valencia, Spain for Campus Party 2007, I'm
having loads of fun hanging out with the other Summer of Code students
and all the nice people from Google.

I have tried hard to get some work done for my Summer of Code project
this week, but it's rather hard to really concentrate when you're in a
room with thousands of people playing computer games, having shouting
competitions and generally a lot of noise. I wish I had noise-canceling
earphones.

Still, I'm currently working on some code that should make my life
easier next week. Writing utility functions is lots of work, but usually
worth it.

Yesterday, I had a fun time delivering my presentation about experiences
with Google Summer of Code and tips how to get into Google Summer of
Code in 2008. The small lecture room that Google uses for the talks and
tutorials was pretty full, so I hope some of these people will actually
get into Google Summer of Code next year. I did not really get into
details on my current and previous projects but rather talked about
personal experiences and strategies to get your proposal accepted.

Apart from writing code for my SoC project, preparing and giving the
talk, I'm having fun with the Googlers and SoCers, hanging out at the
beach at 3 in the night, having nice food and generally enjoying myself.
Sleep is a bit short, but there's always something.

¡Hasta luego!
