Yesterday I got around to release WOMBAT, the WorldForge Open Media
Browser/Archive Tool.

So finally I'm coding for WorldForge again after my last project stalled
a little.

Like plunger, WOMBAT is written in Python. WOMBAT makes use of the
Pylons webapp framework. Apart from the brain-dead egg distribution
mechanism, it's really neat. From the developer side of things, the
framework gives you a lot of help to work on features, not web glue.

I still have to get the FCGI connection to Apache working, but so far
the demo site on my home box works fine standalone. Thanks to NAT, I can
even pretend it's a real web server.
