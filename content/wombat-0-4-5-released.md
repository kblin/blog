The WOMBAT team is happy to announce the release of 0.4.5

WOMBAT 0.4.5 is mostly a bugfix release. Several backend and usability
issues have been resolved.

Features include

-   Tag cloud now really is a "cloud", not just a list of tags
-   In directory view, clicking on the expanded information no longer
    collapses the extended information (bug \#291724)
-   Tag-based browsing now filters on multiple tags if desired

As always, check out [the WOMBAT live
demo](http://wombat.worldforge.org/).
