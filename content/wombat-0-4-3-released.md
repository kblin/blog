The WOMBAT team is happy to announce the release of 0.4.3

Different to other releases, this is a point release to follow the
updated versions of Pylons 0.9.7 and SQLAlchemy 0.5 and contains no
other changes.

This version does not support Python 2.4 anymore, WOMBAT 0.4.2 was the
last version to support this.

As always, check out [the WOMBAT live
demo](http://wombat.worldforge.org/).
