After some initial issues, I have just joined my first XP box to Samba4
running on snoopy, my ARM-based system-on-a-chip home server.

So now I have a spiffy Active Directory setup running on a system that
makes no noise, barely heats up, and that peaks at 2W power usage. If
that's not green IT, I don't know what is.
