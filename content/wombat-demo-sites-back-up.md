It's aliiiiiiive!

Thanks to Thomas Ingham, a fellow Wombat developer,
http://wombat.worldforge.org/ has a new home, ending a couple of months
of downtime while I was looking for new hosting.

Tom's box has enough power to allow running two instances of Wombat.
Following the next release, the [Wombat demo
site](http://wombat.worldforge.org/) will be running the latest released
version of Wombat, while the [Wombat development
site](http://wombat-dev.worldforge.org/) will be running the tip of the
development tree, on an example media repository.

We're currently dealing with the teething pains of rolling out Wombat on
a distro that is different from the one I develop on, but everything
should be running fine in a couple of days.

Thanks again to Tom and his sysop Josh for giving two cute little Wombat
web-apps a new home.
