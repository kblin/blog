Hi folks,

you will have noticed that I failed to post any of my "On the way to
Samba4" reports in December last year. That was because I failed to do
any Samba work in December, spending all of my time on work-related
things. A few co-workers and me had to rush to get a [web
server](http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/) up and running that
allows biologists to figure out what secondary metabolites like
antibiotics might be produced by their bacterium/fungus. After pulling a
90-hour-week to get finished between Christmas and New Year's Eve, I had
to take some time off _not_
staring at a computer screen. Batteries recharged now, I'm ready to get
into action.

Over the weekend, I've been getting the skeleton for some DNS torture
tests set up, I'm hoping to flesh this out a bit more during the week.

Cheers,
Kai
