The Wombat team is happy to release Wombat 0.5.0

Compared to the 0.4.0 release, Wombat 0.5.0 sports a lot of new
features.

Notable differences are:

-   Now based on Pylons 0.9.7 and SQLAlchemy 0.5
-   No support for Python 2.4 anymore due to Pylons requirements
-   Users can now upload artwork
-   Uploaded artwork will be committed to the media repository after
    moderation by an administrator or lead artist
-   Tag-based browsing and other new UI features
-   A new subversion backend uses pysvn instead of executing the svn
    shell commands
-   Automated database cleanups

Changes since the 0.4.5 release include:

-   Art upload features as mentioned above
-   Security hardening
    -   More resistance against command injection
    -   More complicated password algorithm to slow down rainbow-table
        attacks
-   Multiple bug fixes

<p>
As always, the [Wombat demo site](http://wombat.worldforge.org/) has the
latest version for you to test.
