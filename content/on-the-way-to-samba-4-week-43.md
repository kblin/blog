Last week, I didn't really get to spend much time on Samba 4. About the
only thing I managed was working on a patch that renamed the s4 "net"
binary to "samba-tool" while at the GSoC Mentor Summit 2010 with Jelmer.

The rename reduces the number of executables with the same name in s3
and s4, getting us a step closer to a fully merged build. Renaming the
s4 net tool hopefully inconveniences less admins out there. If you've
been bitten by this, sorry about that.

That's all there is for now for this week. With any luck, next week's
post will be a bit longer.
