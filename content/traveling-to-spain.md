Google invited me and three other students to join them for the 2007
version of [Campus Party](http://campus-party.org). This means that I will travel to one of
Spain's largest technology events to meet some other GSoCers and give a
presentation about my GSoC project and my experience with GSoC in
general. It looks like this is going to be lots of fun.
Time to go and work on my presentation.
