Finally on my way to [Campus Party 2007](http://www.campus-party.org/).
I really need to get my talk for thursday done, hopefully I'll be able
to finish it before my plane touches down in Valencia. (I'm currently
waiting for my first flight to depart, not blogging from a plane.)

Originally I was planning to take care of my talk last weekend, but some
nice virus decided that I'd rather spend all weekend in bed, sick. Oh
well, this won't be the first just-in-time presentation. I'm just hoping
my stomach will settle down a bit so I can actually enjoy all the nice
Spanish food.

I'm looking forward to a nice week in Spain, even though I will have to
spend my time working on my GSoC project, as well as my
[LinuxConf.EU](http://www.linuxconf.eu/) talk. I will be blogging from
the event, too.
