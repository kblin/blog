I usually hate it when real life stops me from coding, but in this case
I had a really fun weekend off the computer. The downside is that the
echo server still is not done. So not much happening on the Samba 4
front from my side.

One related news item though is the release of a new version of the
[Yocto Project](http://www.yoctoproject.org/). Quoting from their
website:

> The Yocto Projectâ„¢ is an open source collaboration project that
> provides templates, tools and methods to help you create custom
> Linux-based systems for embedded products regardless of the hardware
> architecture.

Based on [OpenEmbedded](http://www.openembedded.org/), one of it's
supported platforms is the [Beagle board](http://beagleboard.org/). This
looks like a pretty good platform to play with to get a bunch of
embedded Samba images to work. This goes straight on my todo list, as if
that wasn't pretty full already. Still, maybe a nice setup to demo at
the next [SambaXP](http://www.sambaxp.org/) conference.

So, that's it with this week's installment of my Samba 4 blog post.
Unless real life happens again, maybe next week I can show the world how
a well-designed Samba 4 task looks like.
