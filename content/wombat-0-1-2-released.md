I'm happy to announce WOMBAT 0.1.2 with Subversion integration.
While I'm not too happy with the speed the integration gives us, it's a
start.

0.1.2 also features some nifty AJAX magic to make the directory details
go away when you don't need them and other visual improvements.

Oh, and as you can see I moved the announcements of WOMBAT micro version
changes to my personal blog, in order to not spam the WorldForge
website.

As always, you [can try out the current release of
WOMBAT](http://cookiebox.game-host.org/).
