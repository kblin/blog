The WOMBAT development team is happy to release WOMBAT 0.2.1

This is mostly a bug fix release fixing an uncaught exception when  
trying to create thumbnails for interlaced PNG files.  
It also has some visual updates, displaying all available files for  
the root directory and allowing to narrow down the number of files  
by browsing into subdirectories, scrollable divs to better display  
text files in place and a couple of others.

Note that the wombat demo website moved to
<http://wombat.worldforge.org/>, thanks to Anders (aka. Demitar) for
hosting.
