This being the traditional first program for any programming language, I
think it's a fitting title for the first post to a development blog.

Now, what is this blog all about? I'm not a big fan of blogging in
general, but I have to admit that they are a good way to provide news
and status updates for projects. I'm developing for a couple of
different projects and I'd like to have a single place to write about
this, instead of having to go to a different blog site for each.
