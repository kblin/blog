Another year, with a brand-new WOMBAT release.

The biggest feature of the 0.4.2 release is an automated update function
that keeps WOMBAT in sync with the media repository.

Other features include automated database cleanup and the return of the
searchbox.

As always, check out [the WOMBAT live
demo](http://wombat.worldforge.org/).
